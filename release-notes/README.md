# Nephio R1 Release Notes

## Overview

## Prerequisites

Refer to install guide (link here) for the prerequisites on supported environments.

## Support Matrix

* Supported Platforms / Operating Systems
  * For sandbox installations Ubuntu 22.x running on :
    * Bare metal
    * Vsphere Version ?
    * Openstack version ?
    * Vagrant on Virtual box on Windows 10/11.
* Supported cloud environments
  * Google Cloud Platform
* **Other k8s systems?**

## Features

### API

CRDs provided for UPF, SMF and AMF 5g core services

### Web UI

Basic web UI to view and manage packages and the resources within them.

### Packages

* Kpt packages for all [free5gc](https://free5gc.org/) services
* Packages for core Nephio services
* Packages for cluster API services for cluster creation
* Packages for dependent services

### Functionalities

* Create kubernetes clusters. This functionality ia based on cluster API. At
  this time only KIND clusters creation is supported.
* Fully automated deployment of UPF, SMF and AMF services of
  [free5Gc](https://free5gc.org/) . These are deployed on multiple clusters
  based on user's intent expressed via CRDs.
* Inter cluster networking setup.
* Deployment of other free5gc functions. Some manual configuration such as IP
  addresses may be needed for these services.
* Auto-scale up of UPF, SMF and AMF services based on changes to capacity
  requirements expressed as user intent.

## Limitations

* In terms of infrastructure automation, only creation of KIND clusters is
  supported.
* Deployment of  free5gc functions other than SMF, UPF and AMF may need some
  manual configuration such as IP addresses.
* Inter cluster networking is not dynamic which means as more clusters are
  deployed some manual tweak will be needed for inter cluster communications.
* Feedback of workload deployments from workload clusters to the management
  cluster is limited. You may need to directly connect to the workload cluster
  using kubectl to debug the deployment issues.
* Web UI features are limited to view/edit of Package Variants and Package
  variant sets. More features will be added in subsequent releases.
* When the capacity of UPF,SMF and AMF is changed, the free5gc operator on the
  workload cluster will instantiate a new POD with correspondingly modified
  resources (CPU, memory etc.) During this pods will restart. This is the
  limitation of free5gc.

## Known Issues and Workarounds

* In case of deploying sandbox environment on ubuntu VM running on openstack,
  the deployment may fail. Reinstall the packages to get around this issue. (
  **More details needed here**).
* End-to-end call issues and workarounds. (**More details needed here**)
* **Others???**
